# emonVS (Voltage Sense Power Supply)

Three phase AC Voltage Sensor and Power Supply for emonTx V4 / emonPi V2

# RJ11 

The RJ11 connector is used to connect the AC voltage sensor output to the emonTx V4, the emonTx V4 / emonPi V2 are also powered by the RJ11 connector. 

*Note: It's essential to use a 6P6C (6-pin, 6-connected) RJ11 cable, many telephone RJ11 cables only 6P4C (only 4-pins connected)*
