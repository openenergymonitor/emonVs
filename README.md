# emonVS

AC voltage sensor and power supply for emonTx and emonPi

## Inputs 


## Outputs
- The **RJ45 connector** is used to provide 5V DC power supply and AC voltage sample to emonTx and emonPi
- The 2-pins terminal block connector from emonVS (CN3) can supply 5V power to an emonBase using a open-ended USB-C connector.
